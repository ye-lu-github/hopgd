## HOPGD

HOPGD, abbreviation for Higher-Order Proper Generalized Decomposition, is a multi-dimensional arrays decomposition method. Similarly to PARAFAC, it can be used to compress multi-dimensional arrays to multiple simple vectors. But differently, it determines automatically the necessary number of vectors for a given approximation accuracy. 

Beside data compression, HOPGD can be used for surrogate modeling,  model calibration and optimization, uncertainty quantification, as well as real-time simulation of complex systems.

This website summarizes our recent work on HOPGD and shares some implementation examples. If you use the codes, please consider citing our work.

### Standard implementation

Standard implementation of HOPGD is based on full order arrays without unknown values for the components.
